# Image-segmentation-on-UAV-images-
U-net architecture is used to segment the images

Data set used is collected from NPUW Resic from sparse residential repository.

This model performs the image segmentation to extract the features i.e., buildings.

General idea is to understand the achitecture, fundametals of machine learning and how to implemnent it.
